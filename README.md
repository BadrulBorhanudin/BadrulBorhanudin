## About Me
I have always had a strong passion for IT. Starting as an IT Technician, I worked my way up to become a System Engineer, primarily working within a team in the IT Support Department. While I enjoyed my role, being on-call 24/7 sometimes disrupted my work-life balance.

Now, having graduated from a bootcamp, I am eager to transition into a career in full-stack development. I am excited about this new journey and confident that my training has equipped me with the skills needed to achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a skilled developer.
